# About Me
I am entering my 2nd year in the Bioinformatics PhD program at the University of Michigan, where I work under the guidance of Dr. Joshua Welch. My work centers around developing machine learning methods to address biological questions of interest. Some of the questions I am currently interested in are how we can best ascertain cell development trajectories and how we can best integration of multimodal data.

I'm passionate about bringing more computer skills and analytical thinking into the classroom, so if you feel similarly, I'd love to chat about available resources and strategies. 

#Outside of the lab...
I enjoy backpacking, kayaking, and anything that involves fresh air and sunshine. When I'm not on the move, I can usually be found drinking coffee and googling new recipes, under the watchful supervision of my cat, Miso.
