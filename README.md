# About Me
<img src="linkedin%20(3).JPG" alt="hi" align="right" />
I am entering my 2nd year in the Bioinformatics PhD program at the University of Michigan, where I work under the guidance of Dr. Joshua Welch. My work centers around developing machine learning methods to address biological questions of interest. Some of the questions I am currently interested in are how we can best ascertain cell development trajectories and how we can best achieve the integration of multi-modal data.

I'm passionate about bringing more computer skills and analytical thinking into the classroom, so if you feel similarly, I'd love to chat about available resources and strategies.

I enjoy backpacking, kayaking, and anything that involves fresh air and sunshine. When I'm not on the move, I can usually be found drinking coffee and googling new recipes, under the watchful supervision of my cat, Miso.
